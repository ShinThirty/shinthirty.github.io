## How to pretty print a JsonNode to a String in Java

Hereâ€™s a very simple way to pretty print a com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode:

```java
public String prettyPrintJsonString(JsonNode jsonNode) {
    try {
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        Object json = mapper.readValue(jsonNode.toString(), Object.class);
        return mapper.writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter().writeValueAsString(json);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return "Sorry, pretty print didn't work";
    }
}
```

The prettyPrintJsonString(...) method above would print out example JsonNode here...:

```java
JsonNode example = Json.newObject()
                       .put("name", "Example")
                       .set("obj", Json.newObject());
```

...as this:

```json
{
    "name": "Example",
    "obj": {}
}
```

## tmux Cheatsheet

Start a new tmux session

```bash
tmux new
```

Exit a tmux session

```bash
exit
```

tmux prefix for every tmux command

```text
ctrl+b
```

A better way to get out of a session without exiting out of everything is to detach the session. To do this, you first enter the prefix command and then the detach shortcut of `d`

```text
ctrl+b d
```

The detached session is still available, allowing you to pick up where you left off. To check what sessions are active you can run

```bash
tmux ls
```

Attach a session to an index (starting from `0` by default)

```bash
tmux attach-session -t 3
```

or we can go to the last created session with

```bash
tmux a #
```

To split a pane horizontally

```text
ctrl+b "
```

To split pane vertically

```text
ctrl+b %
```

To move from pane to pane, simply use the prefix followed by the arrow key

```text
ctrl+b [arrow key]
```

### Resizing Panes

For this, we will go into the tmux prompt

```text
ctrl+b :
```

From there we can type `resize-pane` followed by a direction flag: `-U` for up, `-D` for down, `-L` for left and `-R` for right. The last part is the number of lines to move it over by.

As an example, if we are in the top pane and want to expand it down by `2` lines, we would do the following

```text
ctrl+b :
resize-pane -D 2
```
