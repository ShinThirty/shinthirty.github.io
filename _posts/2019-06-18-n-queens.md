## Problem

* [N-Queens - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)
* [N-Queens II - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens-ii/)

A classic puzzle regarding placing n queens on a n*n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. A solution exists with
all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3.

## Algorithm

This problem is often used as a demonstration of so-called backtracking algorithm, as follows:

```steps
Start in the first row.
1. If the last row is explored, add the current chessboard configuration to the solution list;
2. For every possible location in the current row:
  2.1. Choose a location and put a queen on it;
  2.2. Check if the new queen is on the same row and same diagonals with previous queens:
    2.2.1. If so, repeat Step 1 with next row;
  2.3. Remove the previously added queen;
3. Return the solution list.
```

### Python

        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
        """
        res = []
        solution = []
        for i in range(n):
            solution.append(['.'] * n)
        self.fill_queens(res, solution, 0)
        return res

    def fill_queens(self, res, solution, n):
        m = len(solution)
        if n == m:
            res.append(self.get_solution(solution))
        else:
            for i in range(m):
                solution[n][i] = 'Q'
                if self.is_valid(solution, n, i):
                    self.fill_queens(res, solution, n + 1)
                solution[n][i] = '.'

    def is_valid(self, solution, x, y):
        if x <= 0:
            return True
        else:
            i = x - 1
            l = y - 1
            r = y + 1
            while i >= 0:
                if solution[i][y] == 'Q':
                    return False
                if l >= 0 and solution[i][l] == 'Q':
                    return False
                if r < len(solution) and solution[i][r] == 'Q':
                    return False
                i -= 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1
            return True

    def get_solution(self, solution):
        n = len(solution)
        sol = []
        for i in range(n):
            sol.append(''.join(solution[i]))
        return sol
