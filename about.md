## About me

My name is Lingnan Liu, and I am currently a Software Development Engineer in San Francisco Bay Area.

I studied Telecommunication, Computer Science and Computer Engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). When I am in my
leisure time, I love coding, mathematic puzzles (especially linear algebra).

I have been in the IT industry for 4 years now. With some chances working on Alexa, the Amazon voice assistant, I had some experience of
Amazon Web Service infrastructure and how to best utilize them in a large scale project.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lingnan/)!
